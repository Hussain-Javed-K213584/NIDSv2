1. We will first test our NIDS against a DoS attack
    The packets are shown on the GUI on intervals of 5 seconds
    while they are all saved in the log file

2. Next, I will start with a NMAP scan
    the nmap scan was detected successuly
    since there were ICMP packets involved, it also showed us that ping probing was performed
    I will now try a few more different scans, it also detected the UDP port scan
    The log file also has the output we needed
3. We can also implement rules list where I can deny or allow an IP on a specific port
    I will create a rule to deny my kali machine on attempting a connection on SSH
    It will detect and log and IP if it's access is denied.

4. Finally, I will show you how YARA rules were integrated for signature based detection
    I have a web application running on a VM, we also get false positives sometimes
    I will perform an SQLi on the web application
